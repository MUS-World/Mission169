# Mission169

WebGL build here: www.benpinkas.com

Metal SLug what a cool game right? After realizing that both the Steam and IOS/Android version were just running emulator I stated the (very long) journey of writing a level editor for this master piece. I'm using Metal Slug X artowrk for now but don't have a precise version in mind.

Development is quite advanced but there is still LOTS to do/fix
